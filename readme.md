# TP1 : 01.nodejs / Johan LEMESLE

Create a basic app with three routes:

- / explains how /hello works
- /hello takes a name query parameter and
  - random names replies hello [name]
  - your own name replies with a short intro of yourself
  - any other replies a 404 code with a not found message

You should have an index.js file with the server creation and handles.js defining the server's callback

Add a package.json file with you module declaration

Add a readme.md file with title, introduction, run instructions and your name
